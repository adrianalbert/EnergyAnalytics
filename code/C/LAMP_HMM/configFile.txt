# This is an example of a configuration file defining information needed by hmmMain.C
# Leave the labels defining the numbers (such as "nbDimensions=") intact 
# and edit only the numbers under them

# 1. Name of sequence file where the input data are stored
sequenceName=
./lenna64.seq

# 2. skipLearning is set to 0 if we want to compute a new HMM 
# and to 1 if we only want to find the distance to an input HMM
skipLearning=
0
# 1

# 3. Name of HMM file that can be used as initialization for HMM learning if skipLearning = 0
# and is used for distance calculation if skipLearning = 1
# If skipLearning = 0, the file is optional: put 0 instead of name if random initialization is desired
# If skipLearning = 1, an actual file name is required.
hmmInputName=
# /Users/daniel/C-CODE/HMM2Movies/Source/hmmInputDiscrete.hmm
0

# 4. Prefix part of name to be used to generate names of output files. 
# If the prefix is "output", then three files are generated:
# a.  output.hmm: computed HMM model
# b. output.sta: sequences of most probable states using Viterbi
# c. outputRoot.obs: sequences of expected observations for each probable states\
outputName=
output

# 5. Number of components that feature vectors have
nbDimensions=
3

# 6. Numbers of symbols used for each of the feature vector components 
# There should be as many such numbers as nbDimensions; they are not necessarily equal.

nbSymbols=
256 257 258

# 7. Number of states used by HMM; this number is overwritten if a file defining an input HMM is defined above

nbStates=
5

# 8. A seed is used to generate random numbers for initial transition matrix
# Since the HMM iteration finds a local minimum, a different seed may give slightly different results
# Change seed to see the effect of the initialization on the HMM model and the state segmentation of the data

seed=
100

# Next come several keywords that define the methods used for the computation

# 9. Use either plain transition matrix A 
# or matrix A computed using explicit state duration modeling using Gamma distribution
# See Rabiner and Huang book for details
# Uncomment desired choice

explicitDuration=
0
# 1

# 10. Choose between discrete (with histograms) and gaussian (with mean and variance) representation 
#  for the distributions of observations within each state (matrix B)
# Use 0 for gaussian distribution false (discrete) and 1 for gaussian distribution true 

gaussianDistribution=
0
# 1

# 11. Choose between (1) Baum Welch, (2) Segmented K-Means, or (3) hybrid method for EM iteration method
# Baum Welch follows (6.110) p. 369 of Rabiner-Huang. It is slow
# Segmented K-Means follows (6.15.2) p. 383 of Rabiner-Huang
# See code for hybrid method
# Segmental K-Means is fastest
# Use 1 for Baum-Welch, 2 for Segmented K-Means, and 3 for hybrid method
